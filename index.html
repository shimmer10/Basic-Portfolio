        <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Jennifer Grace and I'm a software developer and animal
            enthusiast.</p>
        <p>I have a busy household with three cats, a dog, and a husband. Never a dull moment!</p>
        <p>I completed my Bachelors of Science in Computer Information Technology. I've been doing software development
            for quite a few years but almost four for my employer.</p>
        <p>A majority of my career has been in backend services. I have experience with
            Java, Python, Ruby, and Chef. I've tested based on TDD with cucumber and JUnit.
            I've also used SoapUI and postman with both XML and JSON. The team I am on is currently
            working on created updated API services that will allow us to achieve our services faster
            and more reliably.
